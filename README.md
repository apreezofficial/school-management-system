# Laravel Web Application Starter âœ¨

## Overview
This project serves as a modern web application starter kit, built on the robust Laravel 12 framework, powered by Vite for an exceptionally fast and efficient frontend development experience, and styled with the highly flexible TailwindCSS 4. It provides a solid foundation for rapid development of dynamic web applications.

## Features
- **Laravel 12**: A comprehensive PHP framework for backend logic, routing, Eloquent ORM, and more, ensuring a highly scalable and maintainable codebase.
- **Vite**: Modern frontend build tool for blazing-fast development server start-up, instant hot module replacement (HMR), and optimized production builds for assets (JavaScript, CSS).
- **TailwindCSS 4**: A utility-first CSS framework enabling rapid UI development directly within Blade templates, promoting consistency and reducing styling overhead.
- **Eloquent ORM**: Laravel's powerful and elegant Object-Relational Mapper for seamless database interaction with a focus on developer experience.
- **Blade Templating**: Laravel's intuitive templating engine for easily creating dynamic and reusable UI components.
- **SQLite**: Configured as the default database for quick local setup, with seamless support for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and other databases.

## Getting Started
To get this project up and running locally, follow these steps.

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file by copying the `.env.example` file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Ensure your `.env` file includes the following essential variables. Other variables are pre-configured with sensible defaults or can be customized as needed.

| Variable           | Example Value             | Description                                          |
| :----------------- | :------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| `APP_NAME`         | `Laravel`                 | The name of your application.                        |
| `APP_ENV`          | `local`                   | The application environment (`local`, `production`). |
| `APP_KEY`          | `base64:AbcDefgHijkLmnop...` | A unique 32-character key for encryption. Generated by `php artisan key:generate`. |
| `APP_DEBUG`        | `true`                    | Controls detailed error messages. Set to `false` in production. |
| `APP_URL`          | `http://localhost`        | The base URL of your application.                    |
| `DB_CONNECTION`    | `sqlite`                  | Database driver (e.g., `sqlite`, `mysql`, `pgsql`). |
| `DB_DATABASE`      | `database/database.sqlite` | Path to the SQLite database file or database name for other drivers. |
| `VITE_APP_NAME`    | `Laravel`                 | Application name passed to Vite.                     |

**Note**: The `APP_KEY` is crucial for security. If you are setting up the project for the first time, generate it using `php artisan key:generate` after installation.

### Usage
This project integrates Laravel's backend with Vite for frontend assets. A convenient `composer dev` script is provided to start all necessary services concurrently.

1.  **Generate Application Key**:
    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

2.  **Prepare Database**:
    If using SQLite (default), create the database file:
    ```bash
    touch database/database.sqlite
    ```
    Then, run database migrations to set up the necessary tables:
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

3.  **Start Development Servers**:
    The project uses `concurrently` to run the Laravel development server, queue listener, log tailer (`pail`), and Vite frontend server simultaneously. Execute the following command:
    ```bash
    composer dev
    ```
    This will start:
    -   **Laravel Server**: Accessible typically at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
    -   **Vite Frontend**: Automatically proxies requests through the Laravel server for seamless development.
    -   **Queue Listener**: For processing background jobs.
    -   **Pail**: A tool for tailing logs in real-time.

    Alternatively, you can run Laravel and Vite separately:
    ```bash
    # In one terminal for the Laravel backend
    php artisan serve
    
    # In another terminal for the Vite frontend
    npm run dev
    ```

After running `composer dev` or the separate commands, open your browser to `http://localhost:8000` (or the URL specified in your `.env` `APP_URL`) to view the application.

## API Documentation
This project primarily functions as a traditional web application that renders views. It does not expose a dedicated RESTful API with structured JSON request/response payloads in its default configuration. However, the following web routes are defined for serving dynamic content and demonstrating basic routing capabilities.

### Base URL
The base URL for all web routes is determined by your `APP_URL` environment variable, typically:
`http://localhost:8000`

### Endpoints
#### GET /
**Description**: Displays the welcome page, serving as the application's entry point. Includes links for login and registration if enabled.
**Request**:
No specific payload required.
**Response**:
Renders `resources/views/welcome.blade.php`. Example HTML content for the welcome page.

#### GET /test
**Description**: A simple test route to verify route caching.
**Request**:
No specific payload required.
**Response**:
`HTTP 200 OK`
```
Testing Route cache
```

#### GET /details/teachers
**Description**: Displays a simple message related to teacher details.
**Request**:
No specific payload required.
**Response**:
`HTTP 200 OK`
```
Testing Route cache for teachers
```

#### GET /details/students/{id}
**Description**: Displays a message including a student ID passed as a path parameter.
**Request**:
-   **Path Parameters**:
    -   `id` (integer, required): The ID of the student.
**Response**:
`HTTP 200 OK`
Example for `GET /details/students/123`:
```
Testing Route cache for students with id123Tada
```
